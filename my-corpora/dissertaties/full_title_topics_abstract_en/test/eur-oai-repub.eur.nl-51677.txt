textabstractFor the studies described in this thesis we used a study protocol 'Environmental and Genetic factors in Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia and Esophageal Atresia', approved by the Institutional Review Board, in collaboration with the parent support groups, 'Stichting Hernia Diafragrnatica' and 'Vereniging Ouders Kinderen Slokdarmafsluiting'. During admission of the patient in our hospital and via meetings of the parent support groups, patients and their parents were included. After informed consent by the parents we took blood samples from the parents for DNA-isolation and storage, and also blood from the mother for PCB-analysis. From the patients we took blood samples, if possible combined with a regular blood sample, for karyotyping and for a cell-line and DNA-isolation, or cheekswaps for DNA-isolation.
