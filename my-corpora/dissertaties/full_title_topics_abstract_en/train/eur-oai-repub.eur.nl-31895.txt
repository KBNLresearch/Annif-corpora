Binary typing of staphylococcus aureus

DNA-onderzoek Staphylococcus aureus Typering bacteriologie (biologie)

textabstractThis thesis describes the development. application and validation of straindifferentiating DNA probes for the characterization of Staphylococcus aureus strains in a system. that yields a binary output. By comparing the differential hybridization of these DNA probes to staphylococcal genomes. further insight in the genomic flexibility. the evolutionary clock-speed. the route of transmission. or the possible role of pathogenicity of a given S. aureus strain can be obtained. The generation. and development of the strain-discriminating DNA probes. constituting the binary typing (BT) system. will be introduced in chapter II. Chapters III. IV and V provide examples of application of the BT system. The genetic diversity of methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains as measured with the BT system is described in chapter III. The nationwide spread of a MRSA clone (chapter IV). and the epidemiology of bovine S. aureus strains (chapter V) was monitored with the BT system. and the results were compared with other genotyping approaches. The validation of the binary probes as stable epidemiological markers. described in chapter VI. was determined according to generally accepted evaluation parameters. The final technical protocol of the BT system is outlined in chapter VII. The feasibility and technical reproducibility of current BT protocol as measured in a multicenter study is presented in chapter VIII. Finally, chapter IX integrates the data presented in the previous chapters and provide future perspectives in the typing of S. aureus.
