Blood volume regulation during hemodialysis

blood volume hemodialysis hypotension plasma refilling

textabstractThe blood pressure response during dialysis depends on blood volume preservation and/on changes in vascular tone. However, these two are not independent. In order to delineate the role of blood volume profiling in the prevention of intradialytic hypotension, more information is needed on the relationship between these physiological defense mechanisms. Therefore, we performed several studies to clarify this relationship and to improve the understanding of dialysis related hypotension. Such understanding is desperately needed before preventive measures can be initiated.
