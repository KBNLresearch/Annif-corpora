From Barrett's Esophagus towards Adenocarcinoma: Genetic and Clinical studies

Adenocarcinoma Barrett's Esophagus Gastroenterology

textabstractEsophageal adenocarcinoma is a highly aggressive disease from which more than 80% of patients die within 5 years after diagnosis. Worldwide almost 400,000 new patients are diagnosed annually. Herewith esophageal cancer ranks eighth on the list of most common cancers, and sixth on the list of cancer mortality causes 1. More than 90% of esophageal cancers are either squamous cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas 2. Esophageal cancer incidence has been rapidly increasing in Western Europe and the USA 3-5. This could be mainly ascribed to an increase in the rate of esophageal adenocarcinoma, which by now equals or even exceeds the rate of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Esophageal cancer incidence in the Netherlands is 10.2/100,000 for men and 3.2/100,000 for women with around 900 newly diagnosed patients annually 6. Adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia and of the esophagus, commonly located in the distal esophagus, have several similarities. They show a parallel increase in incidence. Moreover, they show similarities in epidemiological and histomorphological features as well as in patterns of comorbidity 7-9. This thesis mainly deals with molecular biological aspects of adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and its precursor lesion, Barrett’s esophagus, but also includes work on adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia. Adenocarcinomas from the distal third of the esophagus plus adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia are in this thesis altogether mentioned by the description “gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas”.
