textabstractGerm cell tumors (GCTs) are a heterogeneous group of very rare tumors, benign or malignant, which can occur from newborn to old age. They are thought to arise from primordial germ cells, and are found in a variety of sites. This thesis is composed of 2 major parts. In a first part, the hospital records of 193 infants and children with GCTs, treated between 1960 and 2003 in ErasmusMC-Sophia Children’s Hospital Rotterdam and between 1986 and 2003 in the Academic Hospital of the Free University of Brussels, are studied. The long-term outcome for the various anatomical sites and histologies, is studied. Pitfalls in diagnosis and treatment are reported. A second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of (a) 173 patients with sacrococcygeal teratoma, treated between 1970 and 2003 in the six centers of pediatric surgery in the Netherlands, and of (b) 70 patients with SCT treated between 1960 and 2003 in ErasmusMC-Sophia Children’s Hospital Rotterdam. In these patient populations, risk factors for recurrence are studied, as well as functional results and quality of life.  Subject headings: 1. Introduction 2.
