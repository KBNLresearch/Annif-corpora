textabstractThis thesis presents 7 studies that examined the results of balloon dilation and stent placement performed for treatment of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). The first 2 studies (chapter 2 and 3) explored the prognostic value of baseline characteristics on the outcome of the intervention. The outcome measures considered included occurrence of complications. improvement in ABI. and improvement in symptomatic status. The main results were that symptomatic status prior to intervention and renal function are important independent predictors of the occurrence of a systemic complication and that symptomatic status. diabetic status, lesion length, severity of stenosis, lesion localization, arterial runoff are important independent predictors for failure to improve symptomatic status and failure to improve the ABI. Furthermore the results showed that patients with lesions shorter than 10 em had a better prognosis than patients with lesions longer than 10 em. Within the group of patients with lesions shorter than 10 em no difference in prognosis was detected. Patients treated for severe stenoses or even occlusions had a better prognosis on improvement of symptomatic status or ABI than patients treated with milder stenoses
