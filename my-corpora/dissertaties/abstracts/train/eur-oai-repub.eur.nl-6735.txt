textabstractArterial stiffness is one of the characteristics of vascular aging. Increases in pulse pressure, which re.ects an increase in the stiffness of the large arteries, are associated with elevated C-reactive protein levels. This may suggest a role of in.ammation in the development of arterial stiffness. We investigated the relation between measures of arterial stiffness and C-reactive protein within the framework of the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study including subjects aged 55 years and older. The carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and the distensibility coef.cient of the carotid artery were used as measures of arterial stiffness. Data on both arterial stiffness and C-reactive protein were available for 866 participants. In adjusted models, levels of C-reactive protein were linearly associated with pulse wave velocity (regression coef.cient 0.081, 95% CI 0.001-0.161). Adjusted mean values of pulse wave velocity were signi.cantly different across tertiles of C-reac-tive protein, being higher in the highest tertile of C-reactive protein. However, no signi.cant association between C-reactive protein and carotid distensibility was observed.
