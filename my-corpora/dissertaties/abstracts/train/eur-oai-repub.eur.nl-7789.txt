textabstractWe investigated clinical and laboratory aspects in  three different situations of thrombocytopenia in which an immune  mechanism is active, i.e. thrombocytopenia caused by autoantibodies  (thrombocytopenia induced by the anticoagulant drug heparin (HITT)  and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), thrombocytopenia and  platelet alloimmunization and a platelet consumption type of  thrombocytopenia (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). First, we prospectively studied the incidence of HITT using new, will- defined criteria of a proportional fall in the platelet count in  combination with the presence of HITT antibodies, in 358 patients  with cardiac or neurological complaints. The observed incidence was  0.3%. Secondly, in an evaluation of the predictive value of HLA-antibody  testing for the outcome of the first HLA-matched platelet transfusion  in thrombocytopenic patients who were refractory to random donor  platelet transfusions and who always had received non-leukodepleted  blood products in case of transfusion, we found that almost 90% of  the patients with a positive HLA test can be treated with HLA matched  platelets. Third, in studying ITP patients we found a strong indication that  intensive immunosuppressive treatment cannot prevent but only  postpone splenectomy as the standard second-line therapy. In  addition, the study of serum thrombopoietin levels and platelet  kinetics, pointed to an impaired regulation of thrombo- and  megakaryopoiesis in ITP. Finally, it was found that splenectomy could be effective in inducing  durable remissions and in the prevention of relapse in patients with  TTP.
