textabstractThe research of this thesis has been focused on the biomedical engineering aspects of new techniques of echocardiography. In close collaboration with the engineers of the Experimental Echocardiography Department of the Thoraxcentre, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, new methods to measure coronary blood flow and arterial wall elasticity with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) have been developed. We have also investigated the clinical application of these measurements and have tried to improve traditional techniques based on intracoronary Doppler wires. In another field, we have developed a method to determine the radiation dose delivered in the wall of coronary arteries treated with brachytherapy. in collaboration with the Emory University, Atlanta, GA. This method utilizes 3-dimensional IVUS reconstruction combined with radiotherapy treatment planning. Finally, the tools developed for the recording of the signals of intracoronary Doppler wires have been adapted, during a stay at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OK for the study of left ventricular mechanics and the compliance of the large arteries. This has been achieved by simultaneous acquisition of non-invasive pressure (with tonometry) and flow (with transthoracic Doppler echocardiography) signals. The fruits of an old and close collaboration with the Institute Biomedical Technology of the Ghent University can also be found in different chapters. This work is subdivided in five major parts, and a detailed introductory chapter precedes each one.
