textabstractThe aim of the research described in this thesis was to investigate the role of genetically determined coagulation disorders in ischemic stroke. We therefore performed several retrospective studies and one prospective case-control study of patients with recent ischemic stroke (the COCOS study). We studied the relationship between ischemic stroke and various coagulation disorders as well as their phenotypic expressions.
