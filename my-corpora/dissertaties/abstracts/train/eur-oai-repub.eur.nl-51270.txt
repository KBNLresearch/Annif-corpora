markdownabstract__Abstract__  Community epidemiological surveys that examined the prevalence of psychiatric disorders have been conducted since the end of World War II. We now know that up to half the general population meet criteria for one or more lifetime DSM disorder. Depressive disorders are the most frequent psychiatric problem with a life- time incidence of around 25%. Although the published reports of high prevalence estimates initially were met with a good deal of scepticism, clinical reappraisal showed that they were accurate. Public health experts now acknowledge that depression is one of the most important causes of disability world wide. Some expect it to become the number one cause of disability and premature death by 2020.
