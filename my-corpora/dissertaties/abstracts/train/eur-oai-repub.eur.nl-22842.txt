textabstractMalaria is a serious, potentially life threatening disease, and generally endemic in the (sub) tropics. Prevention may be carried out by interrupting transmission, by vector control and by giving travellers prophylactic drugs. The use of prophylactic drugs has generally been effective for both travellers and local inhabitants. However, due to the increase in resistance of P. Jalciparum against the available agents, the prevention of malaria is complicated.
