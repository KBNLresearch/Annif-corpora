textabstractSince the 1980s, media and entertainment companies have developed into large cross-media multinationals. Their international structure, strategy and operation have been investigated extensively. However, these majors operate globally by having local offices in various markets. So far, little attention has been paid to this aspect. In Where Corporate Culture and Local Markets Meet, Miriam van de Kamp addresses the local operation of international music and film corporations in the Dutch market between 1990 and 2005. This study focuses on questions such as: Does globalisation lead to cultural homogenisation and cultural imperialism? How do international cultural industries deal with local markets, and domestic products in these markets? And is there a future for local cultural products in a market dominated by international media and entertainment companies and where sales for entertainment products on physical carriers are declining? Special attention is paid to the operation of the music and film divisions of Sony, Universal and Warner in the Dutch market. An analysis of chart and industry data provides insights in the relation between successful international and domestic products and the major players in the Dutch music and film market. Drawing on extensive desk research and interviews with managers at the local divisions of the music and film majors, this book furthermore sheds light on decision and operation processes that led to the product portfolios and the positions of these majors in the Dutch music and film market. Where Corporate Culture and Local Markets Meet stresses the role of organisation culture and local cultural entrepreneurs for the local operation strategy. It demonstrates that interaction with the local market defines how a major operates in that market.
