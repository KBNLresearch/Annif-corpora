textabstractBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common non-cancerous form of cell growth in men and usually begins with the formation of microscopic nodules in younger men. As BPH progresses, overgrowth occurs in the central area of the prostate, called the transition zone, which wraps around the urethra. The stromal component of the prostate is comprised by smooth muscle and connective tissue, while the epithelial component is primarily glandular. The relationship between the stromal and the epithelial component is approximately 2:1 in the normal prostate. In patients with BPH, the stromal to epithelial ratio increases to 5:1.
