Slightly more boys are aff ected than girls. In The Netherlands, approximately 70 children are born annually with this congenital malformation. It is characterized by a lack of continuity of the upper gastro-intestinal tract that is oft en accompanied with a persistent connection, or fi stula, between the trachea and the esophagus (tracheo-esophageal fi stula). Five subtypes are described by the Gross classifi cati on (Figure 1A). Subtype C, with a blind-ending proximal pouch (atresia) and a distal TEF, occurs most frequently (86%), followed by the pure proximal atresia (subtype A; 7%). As is the case with other congenital malformati ons, EA/TEF occurs more in twins than in singletons, although usually only one twin is aff ected. Once a couple has one child with EA/TEF, the risk of having a second child with this anomaly goes up to 1%. Over 50% of infants with EA have additi onal anomalies, e.g. vertebral, gastro-intesti nal, urogenital, cardiovascular, renal or limb abnormalities. EA/TEF is the result of faulty septati on of the foregut. Other congenital anomalies of foregut-derived structures, such as tracheal agenesis, are also of interest. In tracheal agenesis the trachea is fully or partially absent. It occurs in one in every 50,000 births. Like EA/TEF, tracheal agenesis may be part of a complex of malformati ons, and associati ons with notably cardiovascular anomalies have been reported.
