textabstractThe studies of this thesis concern the spontaneous pattern of motor activity and autonomic cardiac functioning in major depressive disorder. The main purpose of the studies was to obtain insight in the psychomotor and autonomic cardiac dysfunction in depression by investigating the 24-hour pattern of motor activity and the autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) regulation of the cardiovascular system in healthy subjects and depressed inpatients. The data of the patients were assessed during a psychotropic drug free period drug and after double blind treatment during 4 weeks with imipramine or fluvoxamine. It was hypothesised that clinical state and antidepressant treatment affect the 24-uur pattern of motor activity and autonomic regulation in depressed patients. Furthermore, personality traits were theorised to contribute to variation in the 24-uur pattern of motor activity, and risk factors to variation in cardiovascular variability and baroreflex sensitivity. In addition, measurements of the spontaneous motor behavior and parasympathetic regulation in depressed patients were explored for their usefuloess to clarify the cholinergic dysfunction in major depressive disorder.
