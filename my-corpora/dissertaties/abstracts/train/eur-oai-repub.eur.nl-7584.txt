textabstractHypertension is a major public health hazard,  because of its high prevalence and strong positive association with  cardiovascular diseases. Suboptimal blood pressure control is the  number one attributable risk for death in the Western world, despite  the possibilities to treat hypertension. Higher pre-treatment blood  pressure levels are associated with a greater antihypertensive drug response, but this relation is not specific to a particular antihypertensive drug or drug class nor can it be predicted from  patients characteristics. Therefore, the selection of the most  appropriate pharmacological treatment for an individual patient is a  matter of trial and errors. Pharmacogenetics aims to understand  how genetic variations contribute to the variation in response to  medication. In this thesis, we investigated whether five of these  drug-gene interactions modified the effect of antihypertensive drugs  on blood pressure, atherosclerosis, and the risk of myoc! ardial infarction (MI) and stroke in daily practise. The five candidate gene polymorphisms were: the angiotensin converting enzyme  (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D), angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T,  angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) 1166A/C or 573C/T, a-adducin  (ADD1) G460W, and Î²3-subunit of the G-protein (GNB3) 825C/T  polymorphism. The results of this thesis suggests the presences of two drug-gene  interactions i.e. the interaction between the use of ACE-inhibitors  and AGT M235T polymorphism on the risk of MI and the interaction  between the use of diuretics and the GNB3 825C/T polymorphism on  systolic blood pressure.
