markdownabstract__Abstract__  This thesis describes results of a follow-up study in the Dutch PCB/dioxin cohort at school age. Associations between perinatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins and several neurodevelopmental outcomes, assessed at 6/7 and 9 years of age, are evaluated in these studies. This study was also carried out in cooperation with the German and Danish cohorts and was financed by the European Commission. Moreover, the supplemental studies that were performed in the Rotterdam cohort were sponsored by the American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In Chapter 1, a general introduction is presented on PCBs and dioxins as well as a discussion of the results of several cohort studies that address perinatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins, including the Dutch PCB/dioxin study.
