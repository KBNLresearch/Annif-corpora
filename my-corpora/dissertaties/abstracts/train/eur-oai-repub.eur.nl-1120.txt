Hypermobility of stiffnes of the joint was determined by Doppler imaging of vibrations and by radiographic stress measurement. With neither method a sharp distinction between hypermobility and non-hypermobility of the joint could be made. Comparison of the Hohmann surgical procedure with the Lapidus procedure showed no difference in clinical results at short term follow up. Hence the significance of hypermobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint and the type of surgical correction of it remain subject of future research.
