textabstractA short history of ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology is given. So far there is no evidence that diagnostic ultrasound is harmful to the human fetus. However, it is known that ultrasound energy is partly absorbed by tissue and bony structures. As a result, temperature warming can be expected if during a considerable time the ultrasound beam is aimed at one particular spot. Modern ultrasound scanners are equipped with temperature index monitoring upon which the user may decide to use lower machine output settings or limit examination time to minimize any possible risk. The combination of the Doppler principle and two-dimensional ultrasound imaging enables blood flow velocity measurement in fetal blood vessels. This modality of ultrasound contributed to a better understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the fetal cardiovascular system. The aim of this Ph.D. study was to further improve our knowledge of the fetal and utero-placental circulation. To this purpose, fetal hemodynamic parameters were assessed and tested on spectral- and color Doppler derived data.
