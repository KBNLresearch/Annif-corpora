textabstract__Abstract__  Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women in developed countries. Currently, approximately 14,000 women are diagnosed with BC every year in the Netherlands. One out of eight Dutch women (12%-13%) will develop BC during their life, and 3% to 4% of all Dutch women will die from BC. A genetic predisposition may be responsible for about 5% to 10% of all BC cases. Approximately 25% of these cases can be attributed to a mutation in one of the BReast CAancer (BRCA) genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Both genes act as tumour suppressor genes and are involved in important cell functions, including cell cycle control, gene expression regulation, and DNA repair mechanisms. Cells with deficiencies in genes involved in DNA repair are unable to repair DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in genomic instability and a predisposition to malignant transformation. BRCA1/2 mutation carriers have an increased risk of developing a first BC, estimated to range from 45% to 88% by the age of 70.8-13 The estimated cumulative lifetime risk of developing contralateral BC is 65-87% for BRCA1 mutation carriers, and 52-62% for BRCA2 mutation carriers. Adjuvant treatment with Tamoxifen after unilateral BC may reduce the contralateral BC risk with approximately 50%. The risk of developing a contralateral BC may also depend on age at first BC diagnosis and adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy.
