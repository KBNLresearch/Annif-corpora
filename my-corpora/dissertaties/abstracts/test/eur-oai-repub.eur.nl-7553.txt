textabstractHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an intriguing disease due to its heterogeneity in genetic, morphologic, and clinical spectrum. The insights in the prognosis and natural history of HCM have evolved tremendously over the past 40 years. The fi rst studies, which contained data derived from hospital-based populations, depicted a poor prognosis for HCM patients, in particular due to the high incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD). More recent studies derived from community-based (or non-referral) centers suggest a more benign clinical course with an annual mortality of <1%. Another important fi nding is that most HCM patients remain a lifetime without symptoms.
