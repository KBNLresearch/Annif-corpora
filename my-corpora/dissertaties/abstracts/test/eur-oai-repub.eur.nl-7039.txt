textabstractIn clinical practice, continuous recording of all leads of the 12-lead ECG is not always possible. For example, leads may fall off or signals may be noisy. Key information about the patient will then be unavailable, making retrospective assessment difficult. In telemetry or intensive care environments only a subset of leads can be recorded, because of technical and practical limitations. In this thesis methods to address these problems were developed and evaluated using ECG reconstruction methods with reduced lead sets of the 12-lead ECG. Reconstruction was performed with patient-specific and general reconstruction coefficients. Furthermore, methods were developed and evaluated to address continuous ECG registration problems which may occur as a result of changes in body position and differences in standard versus monitoring lead configurations.
