We performed an ecological analysis, analyzed data from epidemiological cohort studies in Zimbabwe and Tanzania, and performed microsimulation modeling. The main conclusions are that: Urban immigration explains much of the differences between countries in the African HIV epidemic; Out-migrants do not constitute a high-risk group in rural Zimbabwe; Risky sexual behavior is seen in both mobile persons and in their partners staying behind; and non-participation of mobile groups can strongly reduce the impact of HIV interventions, and targeting them is a promising additional option in the control of HIV.
