textabstractGlaucoma is a heterogeneous group of optic nerve diseases sharing an accelerated degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that, if untreated, leads to progressive and irreversible loss of visual function. Worldwide, glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness. Of the many types of glaucoma, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is probably the most common one in Western countries. Probably less than half of all people who have the disease are aware of it.
