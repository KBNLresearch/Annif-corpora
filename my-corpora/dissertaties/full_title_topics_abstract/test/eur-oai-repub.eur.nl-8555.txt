textabstractKnee complaints are a frequent reason for consultation in general practice and constitute a specific set of patients compared to secondary care patient populations. However, information to base treatment decisions on is generally derived from specialistic settings. Our cohort study is aimed at collecting knowledge about disease burden and prognosis of knee complaints presenting in general practice Chapter 2 describes the design and methods of the HONEUR knee cohort and addresses the possibility of selective patient recruitment. From October 2001 to October 2003 40 GPs recruited consecutive patients consulting for incident knee complaints. Patients were followed-up for one year with three monthly questionnaires. At baseline and after one year follow-up the patients underwent a physical examination. Primary outcome measure was the patient's reported recovery after one year. Pain and functional disability were assessed every 3 months to determine the course of the knee complaints during the year follow-up. The cohort is divided into traumatic and non-traumatic knee complaints. The non- traumatic knee complaints are then divided in patients aged 12 through 35 and 36 years and over. This subdivision is based on the predominance of patellofemoral complaints in the younger age group, and the shift to osteoarthritis as the major complaint starting at age 35.
