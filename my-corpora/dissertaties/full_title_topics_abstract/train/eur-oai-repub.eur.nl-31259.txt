Endoscopic Surgery of Solid Abdominal Organs

endoscopic surgery

textabstractThe term ‘endoscopy’ is derived from the Greek words endon (= in, inside) and skopein (= to look at or survey) and describes a procedure of investigation of an existing cavity of the body, a hollow organ, or a (surgically) created space. T Laparoscopy is derived from the Greek lapara (= the soft part between the ribs and hip, flank, loin) and refers to the endoscopic inspection of the peritoneal cavity. Endoscopic or laparoscopic visualisation is possible through a rigid tube containing lenses, which casts light on an object and transmitsan image of the object: the scope. The scope is àttached to a camera, which digitalizes the recorded images. These images are projected on a television screen. It should be noted that some organs, for example the adrenal glands are situated in the retroperitoneal space and can be approached both through the peritoneal space (laparoscopically) and from posterior directly through the retroperitoneal space (endoscopically). ‘Laparoscopically assisted’ describes an operative procedure that is performed partly by laparoscopy, followed by a (small) incision to complete the procedure or to extract (a part of) an organ.
