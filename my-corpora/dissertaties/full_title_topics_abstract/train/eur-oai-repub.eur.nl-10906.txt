textabstractThe aim of this research was to study the effect of two methods used in providing clinical decision support (CDSS) in primary care, on demand/order entry or alerting/critiquing. Within the overall objective we investigated the impact of a computer-based intervention that supports the general practitioner in performing primary and secondary prevention of CVD. To achieve this objective we analyzed the practice guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners with respect to recommendations for primary and secondary prevention of CVD, analysed current practises of Dutch general practitioners with regards to primary and secondary prevention of CVD, designed the decision support system CholGate, and conducted a randomized trial to assess which method of decision support yields most effect on GP compliance to the recommendations of the DCGP guidelines. This study shows that both the On-demand and Alerting version of CholGate greatly improve screening perf! ormance for dyslipidaemia. In addition, although CholGate On-demand seemed to improve treatment performance, only CholGate Alerting significantly improve treatment performance for dyslipidaemia by general practitioners.
