textabstractThe first goal of the OtoData project was to evaluate the performance of the Erasmus MC ENT department for a complete cohort of three years of ear surgery and four years of otosclerosis surgery. In this project, our daily clinical care, as recorded in a database consisting of key elements, was compared to the literature. The second goal was the construction of a 'minimum dataset requirement' for adequate feedback information about daily clinical practice.
