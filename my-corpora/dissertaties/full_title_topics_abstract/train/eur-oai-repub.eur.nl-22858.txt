textabstractMature blood cells have a finite life span and are continuously replenished by the proliferation and differentiation of lineage-specific progenitor cells derived from rare pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. l. 2 Stem cells are capable of reproducing them-selves (self-renewal) and of producing cells belonging to all lineages of blood (hematopoietic) cell differentiation (Figure 1.). Definitions of stem cells vary on the model of hematopoiesis used but. in general, these cells are referred to by the functional property of being capable of long-term reconstitution of the hematopoietic system of recipients.
