textabstractIn chapter 1 the author provide a general introduction on median and ulnar nerve injuries. Furthermore the aims for this thesis, entitled median and ulnar nerve injuries: prognosis and predictors for clinical outcome, are deﬁ ned. Chapter 2 comprises an investigation into the overall functional outcome of median and ulnar nerve injuries. 313 wrist and forearm nerve injuries operated upon between 1980 and 1997 were reviewed in relation to complications, return to work, sensor and motor recovery. Twentyone percent (21%) of the study-population achieved ‘good’ sensory recovery. ‘Good’ motor recovery occurred in forty-nine percent. Motor recovery, progress of sensory reinnervation and number of severed structures were related to the type of injury. Time between laceration of the nerve and the ﬁrst sign of sensory reinnervation seemed to be a good predictor for ﬁ nal motor recovery. A probability of a 24% of work loss, after a mean follow-up of 17.7 months, was found. Poor sensory and motor recovery were associated with work disability. Level of injury, type of work, number of complications and hand-therapy were found to inﬂuence return to work. This study was used to deﬁne further aims for the thesis.
