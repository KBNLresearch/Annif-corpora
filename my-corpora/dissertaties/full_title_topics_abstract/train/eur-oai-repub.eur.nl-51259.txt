Intestinal amino acid metabolism in neonates

amino acids metabolism paediatrics preterm infants

markdownabstract__Abstract__  At birth infants can be classified on the basis of their gestational age or on their weight. Infants born before 37 weeks of gestation are premature, those born with a weight less than 2500 g are low birth weight infants (LBW), those weighing less than 1500 g are very low birth weight infants (VLBW), and those less than 1000 g are extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW). If a neonate weights less than the 5th percentile for its gestational age, it is small for gestational age (SGA), if not, it is appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is often used interchangeably with SGA, although its meaning is subtly different. To be IUGR implies that the infantâ€™s full growth in utero was not achieved, for example, due to placental inadequacy. A SGA infant born to parents who are both less than the fifth centile for height may have achieved its full genetic potential in utero and is not IUGR. Similarly, LBW infants may be term IUGR, term SGA, appropriately grown preterm, SGA preterm, or IUGR preterm.
